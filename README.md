## PYTHON PROJECTS (WEB_SCRAPPING)
#### Tools Used :
  ######  Python, Beautiful Soup, the Requests Library and Pandas Dataframe.
#### Introduction : 
  ###### Web Scraping is the process of programmatically extracting some data from a website. In Python, we can easily write program to scrape website by using the Beautiful Soup and Requests module.
  ###### Requests module can be used to access the desired website and Beautiful Soup module can be used to parse the HTML source code of the website. Beautiful soup makes it very easy to parse HTML content and then provides multiple methods which can be used to extract the data from any HTML tags.
#### Overview :   
  ###### Here, in the above project shows all the steps required to do Web Scraping using Python such as what dependencies need to install, and the codes to run.
#### Outcome :
  ###### Finally the results will be stored inside an Excel File.
